# Da Kun Time (दा कुन Time)

A minimalist timezone converter webapp focused on Nepal Standard Time and Central Standard Time conversions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

"दा कुन Time?" (What time is it?) - A common question from my team in Nepal when setting up meetings.

While many timezone converters exist, I needed something that specifically offers:
- An intuitive slider interface for time conversion
- Nepal Standard Time (UTC+5:45) and Central Standard Time (UTC-6:00) as defaults
- Simple, free, and no ads

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Time Slider**: Easily visualize and adjust time differences
- **Default Timezones**: 
  - Nepal Standard Time (UTC+5:45)
  - Central Standard Time (UTC-6:00)
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant conversion as you adjust
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Clean Interface**: No ads, no clutter

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Time Management**: Date-fns library
- **Development Tools**: 
  - [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - AI-powered code editor
  - Vite - Build tool

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/da-kun-time.git
