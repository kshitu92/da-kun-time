# Da Kun Time (दा कुन Time)

A minimalist timezone converter webapp.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

"दा कुन Time?" (Brother what time is it?) - A common question from my team in Nepal when setting up meetings.

While many timezone converters exist, I needed something that specifically offers:
- An intuitive slider interface for time conversion
- Nepal Standard Time (UTC+5:45) and Central Standard Time (UTC-6:00) as defaults
- Simple, free, and no ads

## 💡 Motivation

- Desire to explore modern AI development tools like Cursor
- Practice with "vibe coding" - coding for fun and learning

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Time Slider**: Easily visualize and adjust time differences
- **Default Timezones**: 
  - Nepal Standard Time (UTC+5:45)
  - Central Standard Time (UTC-6:00)
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant conversion as you adjust
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Clean Interface**: No ads, no clutter

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
